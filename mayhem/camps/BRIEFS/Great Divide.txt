NEW ARM CAMPAIGN MISSION 3:
A Needed Breakthrough

INTELL-TAP:
A pure-luck survival of a damaged construction k-bot managed to stave off a complete overrun by Core counter-attacks, but now almost all of the Arm forces are surrounded on the one large continent on the planet.

A large ridgeline runs just north of your present position, it MUST be taken!

INFO-TAP:

The Arm Commander is not available for this mission, and is launching a massive diversionary attack elsewhere. Reinforcements are impossible.

&RUse the small force to destroy all Core units in the area and build a base to survive probable air attacks that are expected when Core attempts to plug the gap in its defenses.&

GOOD LUCK, ARM ATTACK FORCE!
