NEW ARM CAMPAIGN MISSION 2:
Little Lost Kbot

INTELL-TAP:
In the middle of the fighting for control of the planet, a damaged Arm Construction K-bot manages to flee the area of the most intense fighting and try to link up with other Arm units.

Because of the Arm Construction K-bot's extensive damage, it is unable to build any advanced units and few basic units as well.


INFO-TAP:
A series of short messages reveal that no reinforcements will be sent to the area, and there should be few (if any) Core units present in the area.



&RYour mission is to find and eliminate all Core units in the area!&

GOOD LUCK, Little Lost Kbot...
