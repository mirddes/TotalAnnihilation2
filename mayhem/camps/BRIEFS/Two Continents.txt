NEW ARM CAMPAIGN MISSION 1:
Arm Invasion!

INTELL-TAP:
On the edges of the galaxy at the point where even the spiral arms thin out, an Arm Commander has been hiding for centuries. The Arm Commander had been separated from any contact by both sides and forgotten. The only Galatic Gate on the barren world had not been used since the Arm Commander arrived here. Having spent centuries relearning tactics and garrisoning the world against invasion, the Arm Commander is now looking for a rematch. His target: a known Galactic Gate on an unnamed planet currently in Core's possession a couple star systems away.

INFO-TAP:
The planet is mostly ocean with many small islands and one major continent. No other details are known about the planet.

Because the Galactic Gate was auto-activated remotely (by a falsified "friendly" unit transfer), the Galactic Gate at the final destination will NOT be under your control and must be captured to prevent the possible arrival of Core Commanders. The probibility of Core Commanders gating in however is extremely low for it was known even before the self-imposed exile that both sides have very few remaining Commanders and no way to manufacture them. This means the Galactic Gate can remain in Core's possession with little fear of any "guest" arriving by it, giving you the luxury of capturing it later when resources are great enough to hold it.

If you capture the Galactic Gate, Core *WILL* try to destroy it!

This attack will probably be a surprise and initial resistance is expected to be low.
However, build a base quickly and drive Core out of the area.

NOTE:
Because of the time period, only PRE-Core Contingency units are available!

&RCapture the Galactic Gate intact and destroy all enemy units.&

GOOD LUCK, COMMANDER!
