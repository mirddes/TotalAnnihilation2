Fixes:
Fixed Mex upgrades not showing to opponents
Fixed Moho upgrades
Fixed bombers - bombing runs should not end prematurely now
Fixes to T3 air transports (still not 100%, sometimes does not unload all units)
Fixed build menu - Y key is T3 metal extractor now as it is with T1 and T2
Removed all structures from special damage tables of all paralyzer weapons (to make the lists shorter and hopefully more reliable at applying stun)
Minelayer "nano-disrupt" should work now for clearing trees, rocks etc, not for stunning units :P
tweaks to some cannon sounds
Balance tweaks:
- Flash weapon accuracy should now be closer to OTA, a bit less reliable
- Leveler lower damage, shorter reload (slight increase in firepower), small range increase, velocity increase, also tank speed slightly faster
- Warrior main weapon higher damage, longer reload (slight increase in firepower), slight range increase
- T2 amphibious tanks shorter reload and increased weapon velocity ~5%
- Reaver small increase in speed, armour, firepower, weapon velocity increase
- Scudd and Precluder 50% more damage, shorter reload, just over half explosion area
- tweaks to sub health and damage - they now take less damage from surface weapons
