KNOWN BUGS
----------

!!! Galactic Gates will crash when linked over 32k pixes (about the diagonal of a 42x42 map) - on occurs on Epic (>40x40), non-standard maps)

!!! Drawlines and markers don't appear properly on very large maps (~30x30 or larger) - could be fixed with ddraw update

!!! Capturing units with upgrades will not take upgrade - Upgrade should self-destruct

!!! Upgraded buildings cannot be given to other players - this because they are holding the upgrade (same as loaded transports or labs building units)

!!! Radar Jammers will prevent you from seeing enemy units when more than 3 players are in game (note: this is partially avoided by matching LOS to jamming coverage as a work around - your units will auto-fire at enemy units in these conditions as they should)

!!! Rezzed buildings do not gain adjacency bonus with existing buildings due to rezzed offset bug (at least when on map edges), they will gain bonus when another similar, adjacent unit is built

!!! Hover carriers don't pivot on ramps/slopes - known issue with carrier pad needed to work with upright=1 - add 'lean on slope' script to possibly fix?

!!! Any unit loadable unit via (air?) transport can be placed on any repair pad (note: units cannot be carried in this way currently as OTA style loading/unloading is removed)

!!! Surfaced sub menus cannot be viewed when unit selected (only when unit is 'boxed') - removed surfacing subs

!!! Omni Radar does not work properly on maps over 40x40 (only seems to happen with coverage values over ~12k) - no units currently with this much range

ok, this is what you do
check when unit stops
then periodically check
to turn off the shield

you can do hit check
stop moving check
and periodic 10 sec check

TALON

New Front End screen

Magnatron - Talon

Unit Cannon - Talon / 4.0 needed




Thoughts
--------


shift + 8 then x

I am seeing a pattern here (and should have spotted it much, much sooner). This entire debate stems mostly from gameplay style and culture: 'OTA' and 'New'. As a general rule it seems that OTA players are passionate about micro and precision skill with a handful of select units (bombers, vehicles, mobile defense, etc.) while 'New' players are about maximizing a larger contingent of diversified units (depending on situation, kbots vs. vehicles, etc.) and are generally more defensive in play style. I highly respect the desires of the OTA camp and especially their openess to some of the needed changes, but we have obviously have won over a huge contingent of players by making a much larger number of tradiationally bad units actually useful. 


Hover names... Dominion, Bruiser, Thug, Boa, Python, Siren, Harpy, etc. 

LLT names Ripper? Scalpel, Slicer, Cutter,  Sabre, Scimitar,  





AI
--

ai should build upg first! 

ai building lancets on slate maps lol

AI no build cheat on easy - stall bug though...

AI gens+mmmks? force ai to build upgrades for fus and arm geo // weapons go to 5 resources + facs to 1

Omnis as resource? for ai so force group 1

Why wont vind attack via AI?

ai mkl/oly versions?

lancets on land lol

make l3 top weighted

less pels on land

less labs

ai TACs

less hcars?

ai no jammers

ai factories with spacers? + 4way

ai mkl - try footprint / it builds guns

ai mobile builders and cheat towers for medium?

AI nukes using AA script so it wont fire at planes - 5.0 nukes with special script?

focus ai on longer ranged units like shooter, jugg, merls, mcv, demolisher, etc

fix ai so it can nuke again? tacs?

Remove rings from shgens, asps, omni so AI will use them?

HISTORY
*********************************************************************************************************

TAESC RELEASE BETA 9.0.0
------------------------


SUMMARY OF KEY CHANGES
----------------------

Commanders can now dgun surface targets from underwater!

- Greatly enhances sea defense options

- Subs cannot be targeted as they do not occupy a 'surface'

- Commanders now longer build Resource Gens, Geos, or Repair Pads

- Decoy Commanders have improved worker times for faster build and assist



All T2 and T3 units have been reduced in overall costs and weakened to some extent

- Results in more sustained battles between different tech levels



All Labs now produce minimal Energy and Metal 

- Allows for easier start up and less punishing 'come backs'

- Sea based labs produce more resources than land due to 'water cooling' 



Sea Balance has been compeletly re-sorted!

- Vastly improved sea starts and sustained play with faster action and easier resource allocation and effectiveness

- Underwater mini-fusion are cheaper and remain pairable for adjacency bonuses

- Patrol ships are faster and have huge LOS improvements to spot potential targets

- Subs are cheaper, yet fast and strong overall 

- Frigates (Vikings and Vanguards) are cheaper but lose AA

- New AA ships also provide early anti-sub and ability to raid underwater targets quickly



T2 Factories are 25% more expensive to build in cost and time

- Results in sustained T1 stage for longer

- Combined with T1 improvements, increases risk of early T2 rush

- Pad direction on non-spin labs can be set via 'special' button


T2 land-based Fusion bonus has been reduced back to +250 per Fusion, while the cost of the T2 Fusion shield/armor upgrades have decreased a bit AND now make and extra +250 energy when completed 

- There is a now a greater risk/reward for making pairing and upgrading fusions

- T2 sea-based Fusion bonus remains at +500, while T1 sea-based mini-fusions now produce +100 Energy and pair for an additonal +50 Energy each



T2 Resource Generators are effectively the most productive in terms of Energy and the least so with Metal making. Resource Gens can power a strong T2 economy but are likely to fall short powering T3 production as the game progresses. In addition, Resource Generators are very fragile compared to Fusions. 



T3 Labs are 25% less expensive to build in cost and time 

- Effectively negates the loss of resource production to make a T3 Lab

- Result in faster access to early T3 units 

- Pad direction can be set via 'special' button



Other high level unit changes: 

- Virtually every single unit has undergone review and testing to function optimally in its role

- LLTs have more range

- Arn and Core 'Repair Pads' no longer make repair arms

- Arm 'Geothermal Upgrade' now fires a mini-Bulwark style weapon

- Arm 'Wombat' and Core 'Nixer' feature light guidance for accuracy vs. mobile units

- Overall Arm T2 kbot is improved as a whole 

- Arm 'Recon' and Core 'Blaze' have been move to true T2 scout role (new stealth tanks replace prior roles)

- Core Bastion features modified Jugg style weapons and no longer stuns

- Arm 'Scorpion' and Core 'Thrasher' now fire at ground and air

- Arm 'Demolisher' and Core 'Juggernaut' classic weapons/role return 

- Core 'Skynet' has added ground fire lasers for a T3 hybrid AA / gunship role (see Arm counter below) 

- Removed Core Viper and Toaster from T1 Construction unit menus (built from upgrade options only) 

- Removed Orion and Ambusher T1 Construction unit menus (built from upgrade options only) 

- Removed Arm Vulcan and Core Buzzsaw from T2 Construction unit menus (built from upgrade options only)

- Added burst fire effect to Arm Vulcan and Core Buzzsaw

- Removed sea mines and amphibious movement from Arm and Core land based mine layers

- Disabled Missions temporarily 

- AI temporarily disabled for labs with no-spin

Key Notes
---------

Shielding

Shields absorb 75% of all incoming fire for any given building  mobile units of any kind are not protected. Shield coverage areas are now clearly marked when a shield generator building is built - but coverage is only seen by the owner and any allies when outside of LOS. Shields are always on but do not cost Energy to operate and only drain Energy when hit. When a shield generator is hit (note: not the shield coverage area, but the unit itself), a shield dome effect will emit which can be seen inside or outside of LOS by all players. A hit to a shield Generator results in 1 second of significant Energy drain. Shots hit within the same 1 second period are not accumulated, but crafty enemy players can provide constant to fire to a given shield generator to ensure constant Energy drain each second.


Charging

Likewise, charging coverage areas are also now clearly marked when the charging generator is built (and again only seen by the owner and any allies when outside of LOS). In addition, charging effects are no longer shown at all to enemies outside of LOS and are only indicated to owner and allies by a subtle glow/animation effect. Other charging changes include:

Charging coverage area is now 50% reduced from previous versions    

Weapon charging efficiencies drop with the number of chargers required for a given unit:
1 Charger - 200% ROF / 0.5 reload time (LLT, HLT)
2 Chargers - 150% ROF / 0.66 reload time (LRPC, Warden - note: Core Intimidator and Arm Annihilator are 0.7)
3 Chargers - 125% ROF / 0.8 reload time

All resources, however, regardless of the designated number of charging units required, are now boosted by 150%  


Building Upgrades

T1 Weapon Upgrade - 200% ROF / 200% cost (HLT, MRPC)
T2 Weapon Upgrade - 400% ROF / 250% cost (LRPC)
T3 Weapon Upgrade - 200% ROF / 200% cost (XRPC)
 
T1 Resource Upgrade - 4x Armor or Weapon add-on  +100% cost (Geothermal) 
T2 Resource Upgrade - 4x Armor/Shielding  150% cost (Fusion)
T3 Resource Upgrade - 4x Armor/Shielding and 150% Energy bonus  150% cost (Experimental Fusion)
