//  AI Profile name:
//
//    DEFAULT (this version does NOT build ships)
//
//
//  Version: 1.3.6
//  Release date: April 30, 2019
//
//  Details about this version:
//
//    a) Recommended for maps with STARTING POSITIONS JOINED BY LAND crossable by AI
//
//    b) DOES NOT BUILD SHIPS or submerged structures (not even Underwater Metal Extractors for reason detailed in
//       "Additional tidbits" section below).  AI is designed for land maps, including land maps having water unsuitable for
//       AI shipbuilding.  No more shipyards or torpedo launchers appearing on tiny patches of water or creeks.
//
//    c) BUILDS ESCALATION AI CHEAT UNITS using following limits according to game difficulty setting:
//
//                                                   Easy    Medium    Hard
//         Metal Extractor cheat unit                 0        3        5
//         Underwater Metal Extractor cheat unit      0        0        0
//
//           The cheat unit abilities can be adjusted or nullified using Variable Levels of AI Cheat Units.  Additional
//           details available at following link:
//
//           https://www.tauniverse.com/forum/showthread.php?t=45894
//
//    d) BUILDS LONG RANGE ARTILLERY using following limits according to game difficulty setting:
//
//                                                  Easy    Medium    Hard
//         Arm Big Bertha / Core Intimidator          0        1       15
//         Arm Vulcan / Core Buzzsaw                  0        1        5
//         Arm Armageddon / Core Dictator             0        0        5
//
//           The above non-zero artillery values are often exceeded because game engine does not count incomplete buildings
//           when tallying unit quantities throughout a game.  That has been factored in to the medium difficulty limits.
//           Playtesting showed AI during medium difficulty sometimes start building up to six Armageddon/Dictator when
//           their limits were "1".  With those destructive weapons having very long range, it is too extreme for middle
//           difficulty.  To avoid having to repetitively search and destroy them, their medium limits have been set to zero.
//
//           Values for hard setting remain unchanged from Wotan's values introduced in Escalation Beta v5.0.1 (July 2011).
//
//
//  Additional tidbits:
//
//    Underwater Metal Extractors and other submerged structures are not built because when AI is prevented from using ships,
//    it is hindered from attacking submerged targets.  This inability would result in AI units temporarily stalling in
//    Standby mode when nearest target is submerged.  If a human player builds a submerged unit while using this AI profile,
//    opposing AI mobile combat units will stall in Standby mode if the submerged unit becomes nearest target to enemy AI.
//    Stall can linger until submerged unit is destroyed or a non-submerged target becomes closer.
//
//    AI is designed to provide hard and medium game-play difficulty using the AI cheat units embedded within Escalation Beta
//    version 4.2 and higher (except v8.5 which intentionally had its cheat units disabled).  Medium difficulty game-play
//    feels closer to hard setting, than easy, because the cheat units included within Escalation allow medium AI to expand
//    faster than intended.  However, medium builds smaller quantities of offensive and defensive units than hard.
//
//    If you prefer adjusting game-play difficulty using Variable Levels of AI Cheat Units (available from link, above), it
//    is recommended to use medium difficulty setting.  Hard difficulty, having higher unit weights and limits, is less
//    adaptable for lower difficulty game-play because it's aggressive expansion is more susceptible to resource starvation.
//
//    Medium difficulty was playtested to provide intended playability using cheat units that would rank between AI Cheat
//    Level #07 and #08 of version 1.2.
//
//    Hard difficulty setting was playtested to provide high degree of challenge using cheat units about midway between AI
//    Cheat Level #10 and #11 of version 1.2.  The AI cheat units allow a performance threshold to be reached at about
//    Game Time 2:00:00.  At that point, the AI was observed to have limited headroom affecting further strengthening.
//    Game-play challenge feels similar to Escalation's traditional "Supercheat" units until that threshold.  At least, now
//    there is more hope for human victory where, previously, it may have felt hopeless.
//
//    An updated set of Variable Levels of AI Cheat Units (version 1.3) containing cheat units used in tuning medium and hard
//    difficulty will be released.
//
//    Under non-cheating game conditions, easy is the only level with a reasonable chance of offering any decent game-play
//    because it is tuned for the harsher economy.  Starting with 10,000 metal and 10,000 energy is highly recommended to
//    help AI expand above a snail's pace.  The AI tries to perform without any cheat units while also being handicapped by
//    reduced resource output.  Metal and energy output for AI is reduced by 50% on easy difficulty setting (output for human
//    player is not affected).  For example, it gets only about 13 energy per Solar Collector.  Metal Extractor gives AI only
//    about 1 metal from a high quality metal deposit, whereas normally it would give about 2 metal.  Easy AI's home base
//    expands slower while hampered by these lower resource outputs.  It tries to compensate by using more Metal Extractors
//    and Solar Collectors.  Easy AI game-play improves on maps with large share of metal deposits (40+) within harvesting
//    range to feed its tier 1 and tier 2 metal starvation.  Those two tiers span significantly longer time than in medium
//    and hard difficulty.
//
//    The metal and energy resource output for AI is reduced by 30% on medium difficulty.  Its factory production and home
//    base expansion are tuned to use low/midrange cheat units to overcome the resource disadvantage and supplement its
//    economy.  Without cheat units, medium setting is usually unable to sustain a healthy economy while maintaining an army
//    and home base at a level that can be considered medium challenge.  However, on some high resource metal terrain maps,
//    it has slightly more chance of offering reasonable game-play without cheating.
//
//    Furthermore, Resource Generator is not attractive for AI during easy and medium difficulty because the resource penalty
//    causes it to have a draining negative net energy while making metal rather than favorable zero net energy when metal
//    making during hard difficulty.  This denies a useful metal/energy source especially valuable on low metal maps and
//    roughens the transition to Fusion Reactor.
//
//    How does all of the above regarding game difficulty level translate to playability?
//    It can be summarized by the following table:
//
//    Difficulty    Challenge        AI cheating          AI Resource       Challenge
//    Setting       (AI cheating)    Adjustability        Handicap          (AI non-cheating)
//    -------       -------------    -------------        --------          -----------------
//
//    Easy          unavailable      unavailable          50% of normal     quite easy (resource handicap is a big roadblock)
//
//    Medium        low to high      wide range           70% of normal     not recommended (tuned for mid level cheating)
//
//    Hard          high             high difficulties    normal economy    not recommended (tuned for high level cheating)
//
//    Playtested using AI starting with 10,000 metal and 10,000 energy (for all players) on land map sizes of at least
//    20 x 20 where each AI color had early game stage access to clearable/buildable land space spanning at least nine
//    (3 x 3) "full-screen monitor area" for its home base area.  Playtested at 1920 x 1200 resolution.  Intended for maps
//    able to support a large home base having enough space for each AI to build high quantities of structures.  Hard
//    difficulty setting includes:
//
//         Dozens of factories
//         20+ Ambusher/Toaster
//         20+ Annihilator/Doomsday Machine
//         20+ Orion/Viper
//         20+ Flakker/Cobra
//         10+ Experimental Fusion Reactor
//
//    This AI profile is designed for Total Annihilation: Escalation Beta and includes units up to v9.0.0.
//
//    Regarding backwards compatibility, this profile when used with Escalation Beta v6.3.1 through v8.5.0 supports more
//    units in those versions than the profiles embedded within those Escalation releases.  In other words, the AI profiles
//    within those Escalation versions were not actively updated for each release.  Additional profile downloads, status and
//    information available at following link:

//    Generally active for Escalation AI development from November through April but mostly on hiatus outside of those
//    months.  However, I can try to update Default and SeaBattle AI profiles whenever informed of a new Escalation version
//    release.
//
//
//  Changes from Default AI (shipbuilding) version 1.2.1 include:
//
//    - Early game phase tuned for Commander to avoid some choices such as building higher BuildTime Resource Generator or
//      wandering off to build a Geothermal Powerplant (it's a build option for Commander in Escalation Beta v9.0.0) that
//      could excessively delay building of first factory.  Commander sooner shares home base construction tasks with other
//      construction units promoting faster and smoother expansion.  A side effect of this improvement is Commander, having
//      less duties, may earlier begin Repair Patrol.  This early game stage tuning feature requires Escalation Beta v9.0.0
//      which has an embedded AI tuned Sidedata.tdf.  This feature is also the reason behind seeing more AI Geothermal
//      Powerplants.
//
//    - Adjustments for Arm Bulwark and Core Immolator moving from tier 1 to tier 2.
//
//    - Improved use of Repair Pad's Unit Repair Tower Upgrade to assist home base expansion during early game phase.  It is
//      especially useful assisting construction of Heavy Laser Tower and higher BuildTime Guardian/Punisher to bolster base
//      defense helping compensate for Bulwark/Immolator moving from tier 1 to tier 2.
//
//    - Tier 1 and 2 retuned to leave more headroom within maximum units limit (1,000) for tier 3+ units.  Prolonged battles
//      on larger map sizes (40+ x 40+) may affect this headroom, especially if long range artillery is unavailable leading
//      to more lower tier units lingering on battlefield.
//
//    - Adjustments for Arm Recon and Core Blaze moving from tier 3 to tier 2.
//
//    - Continuing a trend started by a previously released SeaBattle profile, this AI profile tries to be team friendly
//      towards any allied human players by building some units (a few of each) that can provide shared intel under
//      fog-of-war game conditions.  It does this during medium and hard difficulty settings.  It's unable to afford building
//      them under the harsher economy of easy level because of 50% resource AI handicap.
//
//      The intel related units include:
//        - Arm Eagle/Core Vulture (radar & jamming plane) mainly for RadarDistance
//        - Arm Jeffy/Core Weasel (fast attack vehicle/scout) for SightDistance
//        - Arm Skimmer/Core Scrubber (scout hovercraft) for SightDistance
//        - Arm Angler/Core Refuge (hover carrier) for RadarDistance and SonarDistance
//        - Arm Recon/Core Blaze (experimental scout vehicle) for SightDistance
//        - Arm Tantalus/Core Argus (experimental Omni Sensor Tower) mainly for RadarDistance
//        - Arm/Core Advanced Radar Tower (long range radar)
//        - Arm/Core Radar Tower
//
//     - Corrected slight disrepancy between Arm and Core Solar Collector weight for hard difficulty setting within v1.3.5
//
//
//  Previous version:
//
//    Version: 1.3.5
//    Date: April 17, 2019      - Initial release of Default AI (shipbuilding) version
