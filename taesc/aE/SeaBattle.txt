//  AI Profile name:
//
//    SeaBattle ("Classic" version)
//
//
//  Version: 1.1.3
//  Release date: April 30, 2019
//
//  Details about this version:
//
//    a) Recommended for maps with STARTING POSITIONS ISOLATED BY WATER
//
//    b) BUILDS ESCALATION AI CHEAT UNITS using following limits according to game difficulty setting:
//
//                                                  Easy    Medium    Hard
//         Metal Extractor cheat unit                 0        1        2
//         Underwater Metal Extractor cheat unit      0        2        3
//
//           The cheat unit abilities can be adjusted or nullified using Variable Levels of AI Cheat Units.  Additional
//           details available at following link:
//
//           https://www.tauniverse.com/forum/showthread.php?t=45894
//
//    c) BUILDS LONG RANGE ARTILLERY using following limits according to game difficulty setting:
//
//                                                  Easy    Medium    Hard
//         Arm Big Bertha / Core Intimidator          0        1        3
//         Arm Vulcan / Core Buzzsaw                  0        1        2
//         Arm Armageddon / Core Dictator             0        0        1
//
//           The above non-zero artillery values are often exceeded due to game engine not counting incomplete buildings when
//           tallying unit quantities throughout a game.  Being SeaBattle, some AI could be isolated on islands, possibly
//           small ones.  The higher artillery limits of other AI profiles are not used here.  Limited land mass needs to be
//           shared with other useful structures.
//
//    d) DOES NOT BUILD mobile land based weapons.  Builds stationary land based weapons.  Various amphibious units were
//       playtested but AI showed limited effectiveness deploying Krogoth and Raptor plodding through water.
//
//
//    How this version compares to other planned SeaBattle AI profiles:

//
//    "Revised YardMaps" to improve unit pathing on water and lessen jammed water based AI factories while retaining YardMap
//    adjacency bonus capability.  Status of "optional" allows player to install the separately released revised YardMaps
//    package if desired.
//
//    "AI Long Range Artillery" being Arm's Big Bertha / Vulcan / Armageddon and Core's Intimidator / Buzzsaw / Dictator.
//    Status of "variable" indicates amount of artillery depends on game difficulty setting, as done in past versions of
//    Escalation.  However, status of "no" allows player to choose any difficulty setting without facing AI long range
//    artillery.  Hard difficulty games having AI relentlessly bombard player with vast amounts of Big Bertha and Intimidator
//    can be avoided.  Player feedback asked for AI long range artillery suppression.
//
//    "Smoother Naval Battle" version avoids frequent AI naval (and hovercraft) Standby mode stall.  Naval stall issue exists
//    in varying degrees since Total Annihilation v3.1c of 1998.  It is explained with greater detail in "Notable changes"
//    section, below.  Formerly submerged units are replaced by floating versions.  For example, Underwater Metal Extractor
//    becomes Floating Metal Extractor--can think of it resembling a floating oil drilling rig.  Submarines operate at
//    surface of water and are targetable by land, sea, hovercraft and aircraft units.  With submerged combat layer removed,
//    frequent Standby mode naval stall is nearly eliminated.  Usually, I prefer not altering units when developing
//    Escalation AI, however, the repetitive naval stall significantly affects flow of game-play and needs to be addressed.
//    Although "SeaBattle Floatilla" version removes submerged combat, some skirmish players may prefer this option of
//    smoother naval battle.
//
//    "Metal Map Customized" has AI tuned for metal abundance offered by metal terrain--raising limits of metal extractors,
//    factories, support structures/units and combat units.  This variant is available because I wanted to play an optimized
//    SeaBattle on Seven Islands metal seabed map (within totala2.hpi).  Yep, that was the motivation.
//
//
//  Additional tidbits:
//
//    An AI controlled mobile combat unit can temporarily stall in Standby mode on water maps when nearest enemy target is
//    not targetable by the combat unit's weapon(s).  Standby mode can linger until non-targetable unit is destroyed or a
//    targetable enemy unit moves closer.  Some examples of naval stall include:
//
//      - certain ships (without depth charge/torpedo) fixating on a submerged unit
//      - certain hovercraft (without depth charge/torpedo) fixating on a submerged unit
//      - mobile land unit fixating on a submerged unit
//      - submarine fixating on a hovercraft unit (as of this writing, no submarine has a weapon able to target hovercraft)
//
//    Naval stall has existed in varying degrees since Total Annihilation v3.1c around 1998.  Its frequency increases as
//    amount of submerged units increases.  The following list shows some significant plateaus.
//
//      Total Annhilation Version      Number of Submerged Units
//
//      Total Annihilation v3.1c          5
//      Core Contingency expansion       15
//      Escalation Beta v8.9.0           23
//
//    The naval Standby mode stall is related to game engine's limited handling of AI units.  Its one-track mind causes an AI
//    mobile combat unit to focus on nearest enemy target even when unit's weapon(s) can not deal with the target.  Naval
//    stall frequency would improve if game engine allowed AI unit cycling to second (third, fourth or fifth) nearest target
//    before resorting to Standby mode.  Nonetheless, we must deal with the given situation.  This AI profile has been tuned
//    for submarines to pick up some slack.  Reinforced sub packs will scour the sea floor knocking out submerged targets for
//    surface battles to flow onwards.  Naval Standby mode stall duration has been improved, but not eliminated, compared to
//    Escalation Beta v8.8.0.  If you prefer its nearly complete elimination, see "Smoother Naval Battle" section, above.
//
//    AI is designed to provide hard and medium game-play difficulty using the AI cheat units embedded within Escalation Beta
//    version 4.2 and higher (except v8.5 which intentionally had its cheat units disabled).  Medium difficulty game-play
//    feels closer to hard setting, than easy, because the cheat units included within Escalation allow medium AI to expand
//    faster than intended.  However, medium builds smaller quantities of offensive and defensive units than hard.
//
//    If you prefer adjusting game-play difficulty using Variable Levels of AI Cheat Units (available from link, above), it
//    is recommended to use medium difficulty setting.  Hard difficulty, having higher unit weights and limits, is less
//    adaptable for lower difficulty game-play because it's aggressive expansion is more susceptible to resource starvation.
//
//    Medium difficulty was playtested to provide intended playability while using AI Cheat Level #07 through #09 of version
//    1.2.
//
//    Hard difficulty setting was playtested to provide high degree of challenge using AI Cheat Level #10 through #11 of
//    version 1.2.
//
//    Under non-cheating game conditions, easy is the only level with a reasonable chance of offering any decent game-play
//    because it is tuned for the harsher economy.  Starting with 10,000 metal and 10,000 energy is highly recommended to
//    help AI expand above a snail's pace.  The AI tries to perform without any cheat units while also being handicapped by
//    reduced resource output.  Metal and energy output for AI is reduced by 50% on easy difficulty setting (output for human
//    player is not affected).  For example, it gets only about 13 energy per Solar Collector.  Metal Extractor gives AI only
//    about 1 metal from a high quality metal deposit, whereas normally it would give about 2 metal.  Easy AI's home base
//    expands slower while hampered by these lower resource outputs.  It tries to compensate by using more Metal Extractors
//    and Tidal Generators.  Easy AI game-play improves on maps with large share of metal deposits (40+) within harvesting
//    range to feed its tier 1 and tier 2 metal starvation.  Those two tiers span significantly longer time than in medium
//    and hard difficulty.
//
//    The metal and energy resource output for AI is reduced by 30% on medium difficulty.  Its factory production and home
//    base expansion are tuned to use low/midrange cheat units to overcome the resource disadvantage and supplement its
//    economy.  Without cheat units, medium setting is usually unable to sustain a healthy economy while maintaining an army
//    and home base at a level that can be considered medium challenge.  However, on some high resource metal terrain maps,
//    it has slightly more chance of offering reasonable game-play without cheating.
//
//    Furthermore, Resource Generator is not attractive for AI during easy and medium difficulty because the resource penalty
//    causes it to have a draining negative net energy while making metal rather than favorable zero net energy when metal
//    making during hard difficulty.  This denies a useful metal/energy source especially valuable on low metal maps and
//    roughens the transition to Fusion Reactor.
//
//    How does all of the above regarding game difficulty level translate to playability?
//    It can be summarized by the following table:
//
//    Difficulty    Challenge        AI cheating          AI Resource       Challenge
//    Setting       (AI cheating)    Adjustability        Handicap          (AI non-cheating)
//    -------       -------------    -------------        --------          -----------------
//
//    Easy          unavailable      unavailable          50% of normal     quite easy (resource handicap is a big roadblock)
//
//    Medium        low to high      wide range           70% of normal     not recommended (tuned for mid level cheating)
//
//    Hard          high             high difficulties    normal economy    not recommended (tuned for high level cheating)
//
//    During medium and hard difficulty settings, AI tries to be team friendly towards any allied human players by building
//    some units that can provide shared intel under fog-of-war game conditions.  It's unable to afford building them under
//    the harsher economy of easy level because of 50% resource AI handicap.
//
//    The intel units include:
//      - Arm Eagle/Core Vulture (radar & jamming plane) mainly for RadarDistance
//      - Arm Skimmer/Core Scrubber (scout hovercraft) for SightDistance
//      - Arm Angler/Core Refuge (hover carrier) for RadarDistance and SonarDistance
//      - Arm Colossus/Core Hive (light/escort carrier) for RadarDistance and SightDistance
//      - Arm Tantalus/Core Argus (Experimental Omni Sensor Tower) mainly for RadarDistance
//      - Arm/Core Advanced Radar Tower (long range radar)
//      - Arm/Core Radar Tower
//      - Arm/Core Advanced Sonar/Radar Station
//      - Arm/Core Sonar/Radar Station
//
//    Playtested using AI starting with 10,000 metal and 10,000 energy (for all players) on water maps of about size 25 x 25
//    (especially on map ZM5 - Sandy Isles Extended within ZealMapPack5.ufo) where each AI color had early game stage access
//    to clearable/buildable land space spanning from about one to two "full-screen monitor area" for its home base area.
//    Playtested at 1920 x 1200 screen resolution.  Intended for maps with small or no land mass for AI's home base.  It
//    builds low quantities of land structures when possible.
//
//    This AI profile is designed for Total Annihilation: Escalation Beta and includes units up to v9.0.0.
//
//    Regarding backwards compatibility, this updated profile when used with Escalation Beta v6.3.1 through v8.5.0 supports
//    more units in those versions than the profiles embedded within those Escalation releases.  In other words, the profiles
//    within those Escalation versions were not actively updated for each release.  Additional AI profile downloads, status
//    and information available at following link:

//    Generally active for Escalation AI development from November through April but mostly on hiatus outside of those
//    months.  However, I can try to update Default and SeaBattle AI profiles whenever informed of a new Escalation version
//    release.
//
//
//  Changes include:
//
//    - With previous version (v1.1) tuned for less reliance on cheating AI units, it played on the tamer side (especially
//      when combined with some overlooked tuning errors).  This version offers a medium and hard level more responsive to
//      cheat units.  It will scale up better on larger maps where version 1.1 forces would be stretched too thin.  Easy
//      difficulty is still non-cheating and will smoother get its 50% resource handicapped economy out of economic ruin--
//      it still needs plenty of time to do it but not as much as before.
//
//    - Early game phase tuned for Commander to avoid some building choices such as higher BuildTime Resource Generator that
//      could excessively delay building of first factory.  Commander sooner shares home base construction tasks with other
//      construction units promoting faster and smoother expansion.  A side effect of this improvement is Commander, having
//      less duties, may earlier begin Repair Patrol.  This early game stage tuning feature requires Escalation Beta v9.0.0
//      which has an embedded AI tuned Sidedata.tdf.
//
//    - Adjustments for Arm Bulwark and Core Immolator moving from tier 1 to tier 2.
//
//    - Adjustments for Arm Recon and Core Blaze moving from tier 3 to tier 2.
//
//    - Corrected tuning errors and shortcomings significantly affecting AI game-play challenge during easy and medium
//      difficulty of version 1.1
//
//
//  Previous version:
//
//    Version: 1.1
//    Date: April 14, 2019      - Added new units introduced in Escalation Beta v6.3.1 through v8.9.0 and removed
//                                decommissioned units
//                              - Improved AI naval stall issues
//                              - Builds team friendly units that are of limited use to AI but can provide useful shared
//                                sight intel to any allied human players under fog-of-war game conditions
//                              - Easy and Medium difficulty setting retuned for improved game-play under non-cheating
//                                conditions compared to SeaBattle profile in Escalation Beta v8.8.0
//                              - This initial version was derived from SeaBattle AI profile released by Wotan within Total
//                                Annihilation: Escalation Beta v6.3.1
//                              - Unit production ratios of primary ships recommended by Total Annihilation Universe forum
//                                member and expert level player Race

// to give questionable AI game-play.  Detriments included lack of construction on water and Construction Kbot depleting
// Torpedo Launcher placements by building several along shoreline.  On the positive side, Resource Generator limit was
// reached significantly before other AI, giving highest metal output during early/mid-game stage.  Naval production recovery
// was speedy and effective whenever first Shipyard is built.  Further playtesting is required to determine repeatability of
