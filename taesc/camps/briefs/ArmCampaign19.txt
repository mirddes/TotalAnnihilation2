MISSION 19.005ARMR
Destroy all mobile units and capture the Gate intact.

&YPRIORITY&
Core has been pushed back onto the ancient earthworks known as the Motien Ramp. They have assembled a Gate there... perhaps the final Gate. Surely Core Prime, the Core homeworld must be near. Destroy all mobile units at the Motien Ramp, and capture the Gate there.

INFO FEED
The Ramp will be well defended. Also, expect meteor showers.
