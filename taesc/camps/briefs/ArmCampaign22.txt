MISSION 22.002ARMCP
Destroy the energy storage depot.

&YPRIORITY&
Core has a huge energy complex located at Coordinates 6551:447. Much of the power that Core depends upon to defend its homeworld can be found there. We must &Rdestroy that energy depot&. It is hoped that the destruction of this complex will sufficiently weaken Core's Central Consciousness that Arm shall prevail.

INFO FEED
The energy depot consists of numerous energy gathering and storage structures across the sewage canals to the north. Cross over the canals and destroy them all.
