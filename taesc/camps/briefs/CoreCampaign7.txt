MISSION 7.3CORE

INTELL-TAP:
We have isolated a major Arm infestation on Crustal 2. Arm has conveniently constructed a metal farm there. Capturing the Moho Mines there will save us the trouble of building them ourselves. Control your units carefully or one may destroy a Moho before you can capture it.

&RCapture a Moho Mine and destroy the Arm vermin.&

DO SO NOW.
