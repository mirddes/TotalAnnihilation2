MISSION 6.003ARML
Solidify your defenses. Once the base is secure, search for and find the alien artifact that must be in the area.

&Y*PRIORITY CRITICAL*&
The alien artifact must be found if it exists. We do not know what secrets it may hold - but it must not fall into Core hands.

INFO FEED
Despite our efforts, Core remains strong. Their activities have taken on a certain desperation. The beacon must be near!

&RIncreased encounters with Scorpions lead us to believe that the beacon is very near.& 

To complete this mission you must capture the beacon and destroy all Core units and Scorpions.
