MISSION 7.001ARMT
Core is well entrenched on this rock world... and they appear to be employing stall tactics. 

With two of the four worlds under Arm control, it is critical that we move quickly to secure Temblor as well.

&Y*PRIORITY CRITICAL*&
Temblor is metal rich, though deposits tend to be hard to access and the richest veins are concentrated in deep fissures.

Removing Core from Temblor gives Arm an important source for that valuable resource... while denying it to Core.

INFO FEED
Tremblor's crust is unstable, and prone to earthquakes. It would be wise to have a construction unit on patrol throughout your base at all times in order to make the repairs needed after an earthquake.

The few surviving scouts report cloaked land mine fields. You will have clean up the mines as you progress. 

Core emplacements will be heavily fortified and its approaches mined. 

New units are available that will help you overcome these obstacles. The ever-reliable Peewee has been upgraded to a Warrior Class Kbot. You also have new fortifications and mines to defend your base.

&RKeep in mind that Core has the beacon!& 

To complete this mission you must destroy all Core units, and clear the minefields.
