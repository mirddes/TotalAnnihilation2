MISSION 2.2HCORE
We hold the reef where once Arm had established its base. They are certain to counter-attack. Repel their attack and clear the area of Arm units. 

INTELL-TAP:
The Typhoon model seaplanes will be especially useful on this mission. Be sure to use them. They are particularly useful in destroying the annoying life form that inhabits the reef.

&RDestroy all of the Arm units.&

To complete this mission you must destroy all Arm units, life forms, and build a Seaplane Platform.

DO SO NOW.
