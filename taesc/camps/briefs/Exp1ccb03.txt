MISSION 3.3HCORE
Arm reinforcements arrive as though without limit. No matter. Let them throw their entire arsenal at Hydross. The beacon is not here.

INTELL-TAP:
Defend Hydross to the last. Every moment that Arm wastes here brings them that much closer to their destruction. Every unit that you destroy is one less to face elsewhere. 

The Hive Carrier will provide extended radar coverage, generate surplus power, and repair your seaplanes. Underwater metal storage facilities will maximize the metal accumulated by your salvage efforts. 

&RDestroy all of the Arm units.&

To complete this mission you must destroy all Arm units and Serpents.

DO SO NOW.
