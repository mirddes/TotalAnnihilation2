MISSION 8.2TCORE
The Arm mine fields are more extensive than we had hoped. Nevertheless, Arm wastes time here on Temblor. Your efforts Commander, and the debilitating earthquakes, have taken their toll of the Arm forces. Continue to push Arm to the south, destroying all that you encounter. Every unit destroyed here is one less to face in later encounters.

INTELL-TAP:
&RArm has a new weapon of deception.& Early information indicates a decoy unit of some sort. Whatever it is, destroy it.

To complete this mission you must destroy all Arm units and mines.

DO SO NOW.
