MISSION 9.3TCORE
Scouts have found the primary concentration of Arm forces on Temblor. They have taken our outpost at Cloud Isle. The bottomless vapor pits will only protect them for so long - though it may hold us back temporarily, it also limits their options - a perfect opportunity for slaughter! 

INTELL-TAP:
&RThe implosion device is nearly ready. Finish quickly here, and move all remaining forces to Gelidus.&

Arm may have developed a new-tech fusion reactor. It has incorporated a cloaking mechanism. Destroy the reactor along with everything else. In a few days the technology will be obsolete...

To complete this mission you must destroy all Arm units and mines.

DO SO NOW.
