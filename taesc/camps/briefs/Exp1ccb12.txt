MISSION 12.3LCORE
Arm has become desperate. Their last assault on our fortress left us badly damaged. But that matters little - the implosion device is still intact. 

Repair the base and prepare for the Arm assault that is sure to come.

INTELL-TAP:
&RThe implosion device is activated.& Use every available unit in its defense. We have the advantage. We hold the fortress and the device. Time is running out for Arm.

Soon the galaxy will belong to Core... and Arm will be no more.

To complete this mission you must keep the implosion device from being destroyed - 60 minutes. 

A small matter.

DO SO NOW.
