Mission I07: Solidspire Base

The Arm have built a major energy base amongst the Solidspire Islands.  We have been unable to find their Fusion Reactors and we do not even know how many exist.

Launch an amphibious invasion of the islands. All Fusion Plants must be destroyed in order to shut down the Arm defenses on a nearby island, allowing our forces to land easily.

Suggestions:
Keep your forces together and well organized.  It is important that your ships protect each other and guard against weaknesses.


Battle Tactics:
The Cyclone torpedo bombers are very effective at destroying submarines.  Use units equipped with sonar to spot for the bombers.  The Commander, the Enforcer destroyer and all submarines have sonar.  If you click on a unit with sonar, a green circle will appear on the radar map, indicating the sonar's range.
