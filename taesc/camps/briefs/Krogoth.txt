Late in the War, it became apparent to Central Consciousness that, unless something was done, Arm would prevail.

Out of desperation, and in an effort to turn Arm back, Core began the Krogoth Project. Krogoth - a gargantuan bot equipped with terrifying weaponry - powerful enough to stop even a Commander in his tracks.

The battle to destroy the Krogoth manufacturing gantries was long and fierce. It was a turning point in the War.

Now it is your turn Commander. Fight the epic battle once again...

&RDestroy all Krogoth bots, and the gantries that produce them.&

This mission is for experienced Commanders. You will find Core to be without mercy.

&RThere is no easy nor moderate way to win this mission. Playing Hard is the only option.&
