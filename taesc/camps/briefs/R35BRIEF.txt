Mission R35: Rainforest Construction

Not expecting your arrival, the Arm have moved only a light screen of units into the area.  Build up our energy supply and destroy all enemy forces you come across.

Your orders are to find the steam vent somewhere to the south of the Snake's Spine River and build a Geothermal Powerplant.
Suggestions:
You will have to build a factory in order to create a construction unit to build the Geothermal Powerplant.  Also use the factory to build anti-aircraft units as enemy aircraft have been sighted in the area.

Battle Tactics:
Select all offensive aircraft using CTRL+P (for select all VToLs with weapons).
