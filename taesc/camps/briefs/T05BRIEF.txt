Mission T05: Capturing Terseknos

The intractable Arm have turned the Kathos Sea into a power base. 

Blast your way through the Terseknos Strait and destroy all enemy Tidal Generators.


Suggestions:
The difficulty in this mission is maneuvering your forces in the narrow strait.  Don't try to move all your ships through at the same time.

Battle Tactics:
Your destroyers (the Enforcers) are the only ships in your basic fleet capable of targeting subs.  Spread them throughout your line to defend against sub attacks.
