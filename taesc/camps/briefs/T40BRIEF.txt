Mission T40: Coordinated Assault

The Arm have placed a heavy emphasis on battleships during their naval attacks.  They have established a forward base in our vicinity.  The coastline is heavily guarded by anti-air units.

Every Arm Battleship and Construction Ship must be destroyed.
&YAttention:&
The Arm may attempt to intercept the attack using submarines.  The route must be clear before sending in amphibious tanks.

Suggestions:
The Hive carriers can repair damaged aircraft.  You may need to sacrifice your Rapiers in order to cripple the air defense and destroy Guardians, allowing your Crocs hit the shore.

Battle Tactics:
There are various methods for controlling multiple groups of aircraft:

  1) Form the different types of aircraft into 
     squads (use CTRL+#, where # is 1 through 9).
  2) Use CTRL+P to select all offensive air units.
  3) Use CTRL+O, CTRL+E, and CTRL+Q to select fighter, gunships, and bomber air units respectively.
  4) Select one type of aircraft, then use CTRL+Z to 
     select all units of the same type.
